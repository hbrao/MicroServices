Source code from my streaming architecture talk using Kafka from NFJS

To run these code samples you will need Java 1.8, Kafka (10.2), and the latest Zookeeper install (docker works as well). If you don't want to bother with the RabbitMQ code for the trade validation service just remove the calls in the trade generator.

If you want to run the scripts, you will need to set an environment variable STREAMING_HOME that points to the directory containing the src and lib directory where the class files and libraries are located.
